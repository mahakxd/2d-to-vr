2D â†’ VR Video Converter

ðŸŽ¥ Convert regular 2D videos into immersive VR-style experiences!

This project allows you to take any standard video and transform it into a VR-compatible format with side-by-side stereoscopic output for VR headsets. You can choose different VR effects (equirectangular, fisheye, spherical), control effect strength, and adjust audio levels.

The app uses Gradio for an interactive web interface and leverages OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow, and Google Gemini API for optional AI-powered enhancements.

Features
>Upload your 2D video and convert it to VR side-by-side format
>Select VR effect style: equirectangular, fisheye, or spherical
>Control the strength of the VR effect
>Adjust audio volume
>Generates a depth map preview of the scene
>Runs entirely in your browser via Gradio
>Optimized processing for smooth playback
